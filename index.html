				<h2>Key Encryption</h2>
				<img src="images/cryptoKeys.png" />

				<aside class="notes">
					Symmetric Keys
					<ul>
						<li>Encrypting and Decrypting share the same key. The funny thing is that the key needs to remain a secret yet it needs	to be shared with another party. </li>
					</ul>
					Asymmetric Keys
					<ul>
						<li>Public and Private Keys are mathematically linked</li>
						<li>Public Key decrypts Files encrypted with Private Key and Vice Versa</li>
						<li>E.g. Alice Shares file with Bob. Encrypts Privately, Allows Bob to Decrypt with Public</li>
						<li>E.g. Alice Puts the file publicly on the internet and encrypts it with Public Key. Only Alice can decrypt it with her private key</li>

				<code lang="bash" style="background-color:white;"> $> sha256sum go1.7.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
</code>

<aside class="notes">
	<ul>
		<li>Hashes allow for checking Integrity (File Corruption, Modification)</li>
		<li>Other uses like MD5 two images to see if they are identical</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Signatures</h3>
	<img src="images/signatures.png" />

	<aside class="notes">
		<ul>
			<li>Signatures don't have to be a separate file. They can be built into the file and compressed.</li>
			<li>We can use signatures with a CA who signs our public key</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Certificates</h3>
	<div style="overflow:auto; width:100%; height:500px;">
<img height="" src="images/Usage-of-Digital-Certificate.svg" />
</div>
<aside class="notes">
	<ul>
		<li>CA - Certificate Authority</li>
		<li>SSL/TLS is a popular form of X.509 certificate</li>
		<li>Works on trust of the CA. Alice and Bob don't trust each other but they trust the CA. So if the CA says the data is good,
			it's good enough for them.</li>
	</ul>
</aside>

<section>
	<h3>Hardware Security Module (HSM)</h3>
	<ul style="font-size:0.5em;">
<li>Physical device that stores keys and certificates</li>
<li>Can be used for generating keys</li>
<li>Provide tamper resistance / automatic key deletion if tampered with</li>
<li>Audit Logs</li>
<li>Can contain a cryptoprocessor to prevent bus probing</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
	Come in card or pluggable form to plug into a computer/server. Can just use AWS KMS or CloudHSM (Pricey, $5000 up front +
	$2.25/hr)

	</ul>

	<aside class="notes">
		<ul>
			<li>Security too broad. Focus on embedded linux in a corporate setting. Particularly a gateway device that acts as the portal
				to the sensors</li>
			<li>Security is like any linux whether desktop or gateway device.</li>

	<h3>Secure Boot</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)</li>
	</ul>
	<img src="images/secureBoot.png" />
	<aside class="notes">
		<ul>
			<li>Manufacturer and OS vendor will usually work with each other so that the OS vendor can have their certificate in the KEK.
				They will then sign other certificates to be in the allowed DB.</li>
			<li>PK – Platform Key represents the root of trust and is used to protect the KEK (Key Exchange Key) database. The platform
				vendor puts public portion of the Platform Key (PK) into UEFI Firmware during manufacturing. Its private portion stays
				with the vendor. When updating the PK, the new PK certificate must be signed with the old one.</li>
			<li>KEK – The KEK (Key Exchange Key) database contains trusted certificates that are allowed to modify the Allowed Signature
				database (db), Disallowed Signature database (dbx) or Timestamp signature database (dbt) described below. KEK database
				usually contains certificates of Operating System Vendor (OSV) and is secured by the Platform Key (PK).</li>
			<li>DB – EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE Allowed Signature database – this database may contain Certification Authority certificates
				or their hashes that were used to generate code-signing certificates used to sign bootloader and other pre-boot components.
				If the bootloader is signed by any of certificates chaining to the CA certificate present in this database, it is permitted
				to execute. In this database we may also find explicit SHA2 hashes of the bootloader images.</li>
			<li>DBX – EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE1 Disallowed Signature database – this database may contain the hash of a specific binary,
				an X.509 certificate, or the hash of a certificate that were compromised and/or revoked. If the bootloader is signed
				by any certificate present in this database, or its hash is present here, it will be denied from execution. See KB 2871690
				for list of recently revoked image hashes.</li>
			<li>DBT – EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE2 This is secure boot timestamp signature database. Contains timestamping certificates
				using when signing bootloader images. All of these 3 databases are locked from editing by Key Exchange Key (KEK).</li>
			<li>Microsoft has a process where you can have your EFI bootloader signed by their certs. They scan it for malware etc and
				approve. But then you're their bitch.</li>
			<li>TPM to secure OS? drivers, software, files, ELAM (early loading anti-malware)</li>
			<li>GRUB2 is compatible with EFI</li>
			<li>sbsign --key DB.key --cert DB.crt unsigned.efi --output signed.efi</li>

	<h3>TPM - Trusted Platform Module</h3>
	<img src="images/TPM.png" />
	<aside class="notes">
		<ul>
			<li>TPM is an actual microchip that is used to store crypto keys.</li>
			<li>When taking ownership of a TPM, a private key is generated that nobody can ever read. Commands are available to expose
				the public key. Someone can't walk away with your keys in the HDD.</li>
			<li>TPM communicates via a separate bus which means software on the OS can't get straight memory access to the TPM</li>
			<li>When generating a key, you can specify platform profile values e.g. hardware to match so that if the TPM chip gets removed
				and placed into another machine, it won't start unless the config was the same.</li>
			<li>Windows tools like Bitlocker uses the TPM to encrypt the hard drive. If someone walks away with your drive they can't
				decrypt it because the private key is on the TPM.</li>
			<li>Can be used by a bootloader to encrypt a small portion of the OS start code and then unencrypted when booting</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Linux Namespaces</h3>
	<p>A namespace wraps a global system resource in an abstraction that makes it appear to the processes within the namespace
		that they have their own isolated instance of the global resource.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Process</li>
		<li>Network</li>
		<li>File system</li>
		<li>User</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>

	<aside class="notes">
		<ul>
			<li>Processes can have their own tree. Within that tree can be multiple processes separated from other parent / children trees.
				This means that they cannot inspect or kill other processes outside their tree.</li>
			<li>Network namespaces allow those processes to see an entirely different set of network interfaces including loopback.</li>
			<li>Similar to chroot() except that chroot only affects the root folder for the process. If the child process mounts any other
				drive it will only affect the child and not the parent namespace.</li>
			<li>User namespace gives that user root privileges only in that namespace.</li>
		</ul>
	</aside>

</section>

<section>
	<h3>Cgroups</h3>
	<p>Control groups (cgroups) are a kernel mechanism for grouping, tracking, and limiting the resource usage of tasks. </p>
	<ul style="font-size:0.5em;">
<li>cpusets: fascilitate assigning a set of CPUS and memory nodes to cgroups. Tasks in a cpuset cgroup may only be scheduled
	on CPUS assigned to that cpuset.</li>
<li>cpuacct : provides per-cgroup cpu usage accounting.</li>
<li>devices : controls the ability of tasks to create or use devices nodes using either a blacklist or whitelist.</li>
<li>freezer : provides a way to 'freeze' and 'thaw' whole cgroups. Tasks in the cgroup will not be scheduled while they are frozen.</li>
<li>memory : allows memory, kernel memory, and swap usage to be tracked and limited.</li>
<li>net_prio : allows setting network traffic priority on a per-cgroup basis.</li>
<li>cpu : enables setting of scheduling preferences on per-cgroup basis.</li>
<li>perf_event : enables per-cpu mode to monitor only threads in certain cgroups.</li>

	<h3>Updating Your Platform - Images</h3>
	<img src="images/abPartitions.png" />
	<aside class="notes">
		<ul>
			<li>Starting to see a lot of A/B Partitions.</li>
			<li>Protects against power loss, corrupted installations and just general problems</li>
			<li>The partition is readonly so the program is not modified and there's less attack surface</li>
			<li>Data partition allows application to persist state after new image is installed</li>
			<li>Allows easy rollback</li>
			<li>Downside is that it's slower to update the entire image this way</li>
			<li>Ubuntu Snappy Core and Brillo also use this A/B system</li>
			<li>So how can we speed this up? Just update the application.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Mender Demo</h3>
	<section>
		<ul>
			<li>Mender project provides us with a platform to push OTA updates to our device in the field</li>
			<li>Device runs a Mender daemon which talks to a server so we have reporting on status and what its running</li>
			<li>We can make a deployment group and specifically deploy to a set of devices instead of all devices</li>
			<li>Easy to roll back if we maintain a list of images</li>
